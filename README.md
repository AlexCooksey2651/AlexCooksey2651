### About Me
Before switching into tech, I spent nearly a decade working in the New York City area as a personal trainer and nutrition coach. I enjoy applying the best possible understanding of health sciences to optimize client results, while simultaneously crafting a a positive training experience by respecting each clients' unique needs, preferences, and values as they embark on the difficult process of achieving health and wellness goals. 

I attended Princeton University, majoring in East Asian Studies with a concentration on China. I live in Jersey City, NJ with my amazing wife, Jenny, and our lazy, affectionate, and food-obsessed cat,  Piglet. Piglet takes after his parents; Jenny and I love cooking and eating food from all around the world. I also enjoy working out, reading, playing piano, and football (albeit watching these days much more than playing).
