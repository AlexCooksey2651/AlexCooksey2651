### About Me
Hey everyone, nice to meet you! I grew up near Denver before moving to the East Coast for college and have stuck around ever since. After nearly 15 years in NJ and NYC, my wife and I moved to Atlanta, where we now live with our young son and our sweet (if lazy) cat.

I started college torn between chemistry and music performance, but ultimately majored in East Asian Studies. From there, the natural next step was (of course) becoming a personal trainer. I spent about a decade coaching clients in fitness and behavior change before transitioning into software engineering. After building the MVP frontend at The Coaching Market, I joined the dev team at TeamBuildr, where Iâ€™ve had the chance to integrate my passion for health and human performance into my work as an engineer.

When Iâ€™m not at my laptop, I enjoy working out...it helps balance out my love of cooking - and eating - tasty food (I'm especially partial to curries and soup noodles from around the world). Iâ€™m a happy camper when reading, gaming, geeking out about animals, or playing piano. Lifeâ€™s at its best, though, when Iâ€™m spending time with my wife and son (ideally with a full cup of coffee in hand!).
